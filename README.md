# Allen-Institute-previousMLprojects
Files written in R, Shiny for previous ML projects involving intraoperative blood glucose value predictions and opioid requirement predictions. The Glucose ML folder contains my code from my University of Washington internship in 2018. The Opioid Requirement ML folder contains my code from the PERIMATICS internship in 2019. The Singh lab folder contains some of my code for my current research at the Singh lab. This project was started recently, which is why I am unavailable to provide much code at this time.
